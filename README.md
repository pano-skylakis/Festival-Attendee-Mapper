# Festival Attendee Mapper

The project was inspired by a need for more accurate data gathered during festivals. We chose Cuba Dupa as our primary example.

With more accurate and useful data, event organisers can make better use of their limited resources.

The app tracks user locations and assigns to them a unique identifier in our database. We then query our database based on the selected time and map the data to a heat map.
